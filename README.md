# UBC-CPEN-412
Completed an embedded system course focused on hardware and software design using a Motorola 68K soft processor implemented on FPGA. Designed a 4-way set-associative cache controller, DRAM controller, address decoder, and on-chip memories (RAM and ROM) using Verilog and Quartus IP catalog. Developed C programs for memory testing, interfacing with SPI, IIC, and CAN controllers, utilizing hardware timer interrupts, and part of a VGA-displayed snake game.

[Embedded Systems Design]

[Skills/Knowledge]: Proficient in designing and implementing embedded systems using hardware and software. Experienced in using the Quartus IP catalog and FPGA development tools. Familiar with SPI, IIC, and CAN communication protocols. Skilled in designing cache controllers, DRAM controllers, address decoders, and on-chip memories (RAM and ROM).

[Course Projects/Assignments]: Designed and implemented a 4-way set-associative cache controller, DRAM controller, address decoder, and on-chip memories (RAM and ROM) using Quartus IP catalog on a Motorola 68K soft processor. Wrote memory test programs to verify functionality of memory and memory controller. Wrote programs to interface with SPI, IIC, and CAN controllers, enabling read/write to Flash, EEPROM, ADC/DAC, and sensors via the IIC protocol. Utilized hardware timer interrupts as timers in C programs. Completed part of a snake game to be displayed on a VGA display.

[Course Highlights]: Achieved an A grade in the course and received recognition for outstanding performance in the final project.
