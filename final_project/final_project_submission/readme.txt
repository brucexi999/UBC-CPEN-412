1. SOF file:'M68kV6.0-800by480\MC68K.sof'.

2. Software code: 'M68kV6.0-800by480\Programs\DebugMonitorCode\M68kDebug (no disassembler).c'
you can compile this C file with 'cstart_V4.0 - DebugMonitor.asm', 'DebugMonitor.h', 'std68k.lib', and 'snake.h'
to generate the MIF file that goes into the ROM of our 68k system.

There are severl SystemVerilog modules as well as theirs sybmbols I have added to the project, The best way to
check them is by taking a took at the schematic file 'vga.bdf' in the quartus project.

4. Project is 100% completed, it fully mimics the solution (I hope).
